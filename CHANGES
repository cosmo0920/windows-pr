  or an address for the second argument.
* Minor modification to one GetFinalPathNameByHandle test.

= 1.2.0 - 24-Mar-2011
* All methods and constants are now private. These methods were never meant
  to be used by individual objects, but are only meant to be used internally.
  Note that, because of an issue currently in the windows-api library, some
  methods may still be currently public, but users of this library should not
  count on that for long.

* Fixed the MAKEWORD and MAKELONG macro methods in the SystemInfo module.
* Added many more functions and some constants to the Windows::Registry module.
  Thanks go to Dan Rathbun for the suggestion.

* Updated some tests to handling Ruby 1.9.x better. All tests now pass
  without warning with 1.9.x.
* Added SERVICE_ACCEPT_PRESHUTDOWN constant to service.rb.

= 1.0.8 - 24-Aug-2009
* Several return value constants that were set at -1 are now set to
  0xFFFFFFFF instead because win32-api returns unsigned longs.
* Removed the two mailslot constants from the Windows::File module. They're
  defined in the Windows::Mailslot module.
* Added the windows_version method to the Windows::SystemInfo module. It
  returns a float in 'major.minor' format.

= 1.0.7 - 20-Aug-2009
* Added the Windows::Mailslot module.
* The IsProcessInJob function in the Windows::Process module is now wrapped

= 0.9.9 - 1-Feb-2009
* Now explicitly checks for Win32::API::LoadLibraryError in the method
  declarations instead of Windows::API::Error. The latter no longer exists,
  and the former is a better way to check for methods that don't exist on
  particular versions of Windows. This change requires windows-api 0.3.0
  and win32-api 1.3.0.
* Added a few functions to the Windows::Security module.
* Added the NtQuerySystemInformation function to the Windows::NTFS::Winternl
  module.

= 0.9.6 - 14-Nov-2008
* Updated the RegisterServiceCtrlHandler and RegisterServiceCtrlHandlerEx
  prototypes in the Windows::Service module. Changed old 'P' prototype to 'K'
  for callbacks.
* Added explicit ANSI and Wide character functions for GetFileSecurity and
  SetFileSecurity in the Windows::Security module (since automatic unicode
  generation is set to false for that particular module).
* Added IO reparse point tag constants to the Windows::File module.
* The multi_to_wide helper method in Windows::Unicode now returns the string
  as-is if it's already a Unicode string.
* A couple 'P' prototypes were switched to 'S' in Windows::Unicode functions.

= 0.9.5 - 21-Oct-2008
* Fixed the rescue clauses for unsupported functions for the Windows::Console
  and Windows::Debug modules. Thanks go to an anonymous user for the spot.
* Added a couple functions to the Windows::File and Windows::NIO modules.

  Windows::EventLog module.

= 0.9.2 - 5-Sep-2008
* Added some WoW64 functions to Windows::File and Windows::SystemInfo.
* All modules now rescue Windows::API::Error for failed function loads.
  I was previously inconsistent on just what error I was rescuing.

= 0.9.1 - 28-Jul-2008
* Yet another refactoring of the multi_to_wide and wide_to_multi helper
  methods in the Windows::Unicode module. In addition to a bug fix, they
  now raise an ArgumentError if they fail.
* Yet another tweak to get_last_error in the Windows::Error module. It now
  always uses the explicit ANSI version of the FormatMessage function.
* Added tests for the multi_to_wide and wide_to_multi helper methods.

= 0.9.0 - 26-Jul-2008
* The process of converting prototypes from 'P' to 'S' has begun. This

* Added the Windows::Window::Dialog module.
* Added many more functions and constants to the Windows::Security module.

* Added several profile related functions to the Windows::Shell module.
* Changed the prototype of ConvertSidToStringSid and ConvertStringSidToSid
  back to 'LP' in the Windows::Security module. I'm not sure why I changed
  those before. If this causes too much grief I'll change them back.

* Important bug fixes for the Windows::Directory, Windows::Memory,
  Windows::Synchronize and Windows::Volume modules. These were either fixes
  for the function declaration or the wrapper method. Thanks go to Katsuyuki
